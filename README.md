# Bridge-Crossing

A family has to cross a bridge over a lake in the middle of the night. The bridge can only hold 2 people at a time. Also, there is only one lamp that has to be carried by one of the people that crosses the bridge. Every member of the family needs different time in order to come across and it is the same one every time they move from one end of the land to another. When two different people cross the bridge, the time needed is the time that the slower one needed to come across.

## Program

The time needed for every person of the family it is known and the program must find the best solution, meaning the fastest way for all the members of the family to cross the bridge (from the left side of the bridge to the right).

The number of the people of the family (N) and their time needed to cross the bridge has to be given as an entrance on the program.
